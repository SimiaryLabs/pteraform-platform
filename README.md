# Pteraform Platform
Pteraform is a platform designed to put geographic and temporal lenses on large document collections.  Pteraform works by ingesting documents, parsing out the geographic and temporal content, and storing the structured representation of this information in a MongoDB JSON document.  This structured data then becomes the basis for analysis.  Pteraform is an ongoing project, and we welcome contributions and feature requests from the community.

The Pteraform Platform is designed to be the UI front end to the [Pteraform API](https://github.com/SimiaryLabs/pteraform-api).
